- Worked with [Ondrej Ruttkay](http://cz.linkedin.com/pub/ondrej-ruttkay/8/5aa/608) to build a real-time message-passing-based operating system for the ARM-based Cirrus EP9302, along with an application using this OS to control M&auml;rklin model trains
- Wrote a raytracer with randomized supersampling, Phong lighting, and support for implicit surfaces
- Wrote a procedural content generation engine to render interactive natural landscapes with fractal trees, Catmull-Clark subdivision-based rocks, and multiple-frequency Perlin noise textures

To self-proclaimed CS rockstars at the University of Waterloo: under no circumstances take more than one of Computer Graphics, Real-Time Programming, and Compilers in a semester. There are better ways to prove yourself. 

Individually, however, these courses are eminently worthwhile; you have to dive deep and produce something non-trivial.
