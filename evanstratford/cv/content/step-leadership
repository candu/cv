- Organized talks by leading renewable energy experts on campus
- Developed administration tools for the STEP website

STEP was always in a precarious position: the University of Waterloo administration made it abundantly clear that they wanted nothing to do with a bunch of unwashed hippies and their crazy ideas. Like energy self-sufficiency - crazy, right?

We nevertheless succeeded in erecting a 2kW photovoltaic array, installing solar water heating for the on-campus pool facilities, organizing regular seminars on renewable energy and sustainable design, showing off our generator bike anywhere we could, and booking tours at local wind farms. We gave presentations at conference, local eco-festivals, even elementary schools.
