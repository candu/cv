Bike to the Earth

- Biked 12 178 km from Copenhagen to Istanbul via Portugal over six months
- Wrote bi-daily blog posts chronicling the journey
- Designed, built, and deployed the Bike to the Earth website using CouchDB, Pylons, and jQuery
- Wrote proof-of-concept functionality to create daily maps from GPS readings using gpsd, Python, and Google Static Maps API
- Wrote proof-of-concept functionality to compile videos from frames taken using an inexpensive handlebar-mounted webcam using ffmpeg
- Tested these out on training rides around Oakville

When we started the trip, though, we quickly found that our daily ride exceeded the battery life of the laptop. For this reason, these implementations remained proof-of-concept; we'll refine this concept with better hardware next time!
