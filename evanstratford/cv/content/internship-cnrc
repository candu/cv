I lived on campus in these townhouse-style apartments with an International Business graduate student from near Qu&eacute;bec. He worked in Ottawa for some government office. We devised a pact: he would speak in English, I would speak in French. When it comes to language practice, there's no substitute for direct practice. Actually, that goes for most fields of human endeavor.
