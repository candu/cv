I worked on the [Site Integrity team](http://www.scribd.com/doc/70451272/Facebook-Security-Infographic),
which *prevents spam and fraud in real-time* across all Facebook products.
I developed an *unsupervised learning system* to detect spam across 
*billions of user messages per day*. This work resulted in a
[patent](http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=20120124664.PGNR.&OS=DN/20120124664&RS=DN/20120124664)
on the underlying classification and user feedback mechanisms.

I also optimized our generalized spam classification framework,
*reducing CPU load by 15%* after identifying performance issues with gprof.

For a hackathon, I
*ported [rQRCode](http://whomwah.github.com/rqrcode/) to a C++ Thrift service*
and helped build out a demo product for *social graph actions via QR codes*.
Three years later, this Thrift service is now being incorporated into
Facebook's Japan-specific QR offerings.
