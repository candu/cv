I worked on the Site Integrity team, which *prevents spam and fraud in
real-time* across all Facebook products. I developed an *unsupervised machine
learning system* to scan *billions of messages per day* for spam. I also
used gprof to *identify high-value optimizations* in our generalized spam
classification framework, *reducing CPU load by 15%*.

For a hackathon, I *ported rQRCode to a C++-backed Thrift service* and helped
build out a demo showing *QR code integration with Facebook*. Three years
later, my Thrift service is now being incorporated into Facebook's
Japan-specific QR offerings.
