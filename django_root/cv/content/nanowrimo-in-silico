I wrote [In Silico](https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AaTsQ-x5FAZmZGd4YzU0ODVfMjRkaGZxOGpjdA&authkey=CMOCx-IJ&hl=en_US&authkey=CMOCx-IJ),
meeting the [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) goal of *50 000 words in one month*. In Silico envisions
a near-future world with ubiquitous implantable computing devices. To stave
off societal collapse due to widespread video game addiction, a shadowy
consortium of government officials and industry leaders constructs the perfect
antidote: a game whose purpose is to maintain public order.
