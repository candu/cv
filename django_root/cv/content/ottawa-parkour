- Helped to organize weekly gym meets for 5-10 traceurs in the Ottawa region

I was really into parkour for a while. Aside from being insanely fun, it's also an excellent example of a distributed community: you can go most anywhere and find traceurs (or traceuses, following the French nomenclature here.)
