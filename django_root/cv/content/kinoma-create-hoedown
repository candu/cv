Using the newly-announced [Kinoma Create](LINK) hardware prototyping platform,
[Valkyrie Savage](LINK) and I built Hoedown!, a unique game that we
demonstrated at the Kinoma stand during [SXSW 2014](LINK).

In Hoedown!, players are
measured for different qualities using [physical sensors](LINK).  These
measurements are then used to determine a character class for the player, which
is presented to them in the form of a character sheet printed on a
[BERG Little Printer](LINK).  Players then find other players from each of the
seven character classes, with whom they complete small shared tasks.

The source code for Hoedown! is available [here](LINK).

TODO: put source code up
