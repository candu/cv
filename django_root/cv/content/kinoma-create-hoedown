Using the newly-announced [Kinoma Create](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kinoma-create) hardware prototyping platform,
[Valkyrie Savage](http://valkyriesavage.com/) and I built Hoedown!, a unique game that we
demonstrated at the Kinoma stand during [SXSW 2014](http://sxsw.com/).

In Hoedown!, players are
measured for different qualities using physical sensors.  These
measurements are then used to determine a character class for the player, which
is presented to them in the form of a character sheet printed on a
[BERG Little Printer](http://littleprinter.com/).  Players then find other players from each of the
seven character classes, with whom they complete small shared tasks.

The source code for Hoedown! is available on [github](https://github.com/savageinternet/hoedown), though
be warned that said code remains in a hackathon-ish state.  You can see
a time-lapse of us [hard at work](http://blog.kinoma.com/2014/02/sxsw-launch-countdown/).
