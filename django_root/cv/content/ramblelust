The [ramblelust blog](LINK) chronicles the travels of [Valkyrie Savage](LINK)
and myself through Australia, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and
Korea during the summer of 2013.  We also have a [photostream](LINK) from the
trip.

This trip was less structured than our [massive bike trip](LINK), but no less
fascinating.  We ate all the food, couchsurfed as much as we could, rode a
ramshackle 125cc scooter motorbike around Vietnam, hiked halfway around the
[Jeju Olle](LINK) in Korea, completed a few quests from [expedition!](LINK),
got our [PADI Open Water Diver](LINK) certifications, and sweltered in the
muggy heat.  (We did a lot of sweltering, let me tell you.)
