The [ramblelust blog](http://ramblelust.savageinter.net/) chronicles the travels of [Valkyrie Savage](http://valkyriesavage.com/)
and myself through Australia, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and
Korea during the summer of 2013.  We also have [photos](https://plus.google.com/photos/110802499951011570764/albums?banner=pwa) from the
trip.

This trip was less structured than our [massive bike trip](http://fearlesstost.github.io/biketotheearth/), but no less
fascinating.  We ate all the food, couchsurfed as much as we could, rode a
ramshackle 125cc scooter motorbike around Vietnam, hiked halfway around the
[Jeju Olle](http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_4_12_13.jsp) in Korea, completed a few quests from [expedition!](https://expedition.savageinter.net/),
got our [PADI Open Water Diver](http://www.padi.com/scuba/padi-courses/diver-level-courses/view-all-padi-courses/open-water-diver/) certifications, and sweltered in the
muggy heat.  (We did a lot of sweltering, let me tell you.)
