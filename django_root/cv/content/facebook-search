As a [bootcamper](https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=177577963919),
I optimized our site-wide JavaScript-based CSS package loading framework to
cut down on expensive setInterval() calls.

I then joined the Search Infrastructure team and built
*search for Facebook Groups*, the first fulltext search product to
use our distributed graph search system. This was a *full-stack project*; I was
responsible for everything from *indexing* to *realtime updates* to *frontend
development*. After rollout, I maintained this product by managing a 
weekly push process, building dashboards, and working with teammates to
resolve operational issues. I also *improved search quality*, using
detailed query log analysis to prioritize fixes to the indexing process and
UI.

After that, I worked more closely with the Search Infrastructure team on
improving our core graph search system. I *automated index builds*, making the
process of pushing our 50 TB index quicker and more reliable. As part of the
oncall rotation, I periodically *managed that push process end-to-end*. I
instrumented our system to *report a breakdown of CPU/network usage*, allowing
us to precisely target our optimizations at specific common queries and
high-volume callers.
