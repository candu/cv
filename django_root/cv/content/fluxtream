I contributed briefly to [Fluxtream](https://fluxtream.org/welcome), a toolkit for gathering and viewing
your personal data.  My main contribution was to clean up the
[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) code that managed the time pan/zoom
controls, fixing several bugs in the process.

In a broader sense, this work foreshadowed [datafist](http://datafist.savageevan.com/) and ponder.
