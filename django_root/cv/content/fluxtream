I [contributed briefly](LINK) to Fluxtream, a toolkit for gathering and viewing
your personal data.  My main contribution was to clean up the
[Backbone](LINK) and [jQuery](LINK) code that managed the time pan/zoom
controls, fixing several bugs in the process.

In a broader sense, this work foreshadowed [datafist](LINK) and my
[current project with Intel Labs](LINK).
