The University of Waterloo is exactly right to invest its resources in the co-operative system. This system gave me invaluable work experience at a time when the larger economy was in turmoil. It brought me into diverse environments - everything from startups to research groups to Silicon Valley behemoths. It created opportunities to practice French, explore California, and meet others who share my passion for technology.
