After spending a year with the Search Infrastructure team, I switched gears and
moved to the Core Photos team. This horizontal role switching is highly encouraged
at Facebook.

I took a failing face detection/recognition system and 
*rebuilt it for scalability*, achieving *99.9% reliability* and a
*tagging boost of 2%*. I then worked with
[Lubomir Bourdev](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lbourdev/) to build
*easily reusable detection/recognition components*, making it easier to drive
further improvements to our tag suggestion systems.

The bulk of my time with Core Photos was spent driving a major initiative to migrate
*all photos-related data* into TAO. TAO provides access to our social graph data
via a simple API that abstracts away Memcache/MySQL. 

The migration required *extensive planning*, 
*frequent communication both within and across teams*, and
*broad knowledge of Facebook's codebase*. When I joined Core Photos, several people
had previously tried and failed to gain traction on this project. By the time I left,
we had *successfully migrated all photo tags* and had a clear plan for completing
the rest of the migration.
