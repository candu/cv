- Taught myself algorithms, design patterns, and other required knowledge for the 2005 Computer Science AB
- Received a score of 5, the highest possible score

There wasn't even a Computer Science course at [NJC](http://www.njc.ch). I signed up for this exam anyways. Even though this wasn't accepted by the University of Waterloo as credit equivalent, it gave me a powerful headstart in their freshman year courses.
