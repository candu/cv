- Taught myself algorithms, design patterns, and other required knowledge for the 2005 Computer Science AB
- Received a score of 5, the highest possible score

There wasn't even a Computer Science course at [NJC](http://www.njc.ch). I signed up for this exam anyways. Despite the University of Waterloo's refusal to accept it as credit equivalent for their freshman Java course, this gave me a powerful headstart in college.

Note to recalcitrant bureaucrats: when you refuse to acknowledge initiative, it sends the signal that initiative isn't worth it. This is the worst thing you can do, especially in an academic context. Fortunately for me, I've always been wary of external signals...
