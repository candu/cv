Since [NJC](http://www.njc.ch) didn't offer a Computer Science course,
I *taught myself all required material* for the 2005 Computer Science AB.
I *received the highest possible score* on this examination.

Even though this wasn't accepted by the University of Waterloo as credit
equivalent, it gave me a powerful headstart in their freshman year courses.
