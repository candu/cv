- Designates students in excellent standing with cumulative averages of 87% or higher

Do I place much stock in marks? Not really. For instance, one of my most rewarding classes was General Relativity. I had neither the physics nor the differential geometry background when I started, so I had to learn and learn quickly; with incredible effort, I managed a 66%. That 66% is more meaningful to me than most of my academic record.
