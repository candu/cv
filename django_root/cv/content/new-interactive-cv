- Designed and built [my online CV](http://cv.evanstratford.com) using Django, XHPy, and mootools
- Added views optimized for print and mobile media, as well as for browsers lacking JavaScript support

This was mainly a project to familiarize myself with Django and mootools, as well as to try out my XHPy templating framework. If you look through [the commit history](https://github.com/candu/evanstratford/commits/master), you'll see a frantic sequence of experiments like hierarchical tag namespaces, tag similarity metrics, and vertical positioning time scales.

Most of that was subsequently removed. Do I regret trying these things out? Definitely not; they were fantastic for hitting some of the corners and rough spots of my chosen stack. That said, there's a powerful "minimum viable product" argument lurking here...
