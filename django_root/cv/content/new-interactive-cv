I design, build, and maintain [this online CV](http://cv.savageevan.com)
using Django, XHPy, and mootools. It uses a
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-inspired *compiled YAML/Markdown*
approach to make adding new entries simple.

You can click on any tag to *filter my life experiences*. My CV also comes
equipped with a print stylesheet that is integrated with the tag system, so
you can even *print a customized version* to suit your needs.

To top it all off, the code is *open-sourced* on
[Github](https://github.com/candu/cv).
