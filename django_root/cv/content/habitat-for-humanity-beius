I travelled to Beiuș, Romania where I *helped to finish construction on two
homes* during a one-week build.

For the first house, I operated the circular
saw. The foreman would request lengths to cut, I would measure and cut them.
After a while, he started coming back with these pieces, telling me that they
were too short. I cut them again - and soon he was back again with the same
complaint.

A couple of iterations later, I suspected something was amiss. As it turns
out, our rulers were not quite identical. Since there were no more rulers, I
instead corrected for the difference. There were no more complaints.
