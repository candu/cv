- Helped to finish two homes in Beius, Romania during a one-week build

For the first house, my job was to operate the circular saw; the foreman would come to me with lengths to cut, I would cut them. After a while, he started coming back with these pieces, telling me that they were too short. I cut them again - and soon he was back again with the same complaint.

A couple of iterations later, I suspected something was amiss. As it turns out, our rulers were not quite identical; since there were no more rulers, I learned instead to correct for the difference. There were no more complaints.
