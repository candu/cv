ponder has much the same goal as [datafist](http://datafist.savageevan.com/): to *enable all
self-trackers to get more value from their personal data*, regardless of
experience with statistics or programming.  It is currently in development; this
CV will be updated with a link when it goes live.

ponder uses [Spring MVC](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html) as the web application framework, [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/)
for communication with the API syncing service, [d3](http://d3js.org/) for visualizations,
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for UI.  By far the largest challenge has
been working with third-party APIs, which have quite divergent opinions on how
to deal with time, data formatting, pagination, etc.

This project draws heavily on ethnographic research and visual/interaction
design from the team at [Intel Labs](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/intel-research.html).  I've slowly come to accept that,
even in software engineering, many of the hardest problems are not
engineering problems - and so it is with this project.  Without the dedicated
work of [Dawn Nafus](http://dawnnafus.wordpress.com/), [Pete Denman](http://quantifiedself.com/2013/07/peter-denman-on-visualizing-data-with-biomimicry/), [Lama Nachman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi7HeDsPBHg), and
several others, this project would not exist.
