*Ponder is data analysis for the rest of us.  You can look for patterns,
answer tough questions, or discover habits you didn’t even know you had.
You don’t need a stats degree to do it.*

[ponder](LINK) has much the same goal as [datafist](LINK): to enable all
self-trackers to get more value from their personal data, regardless of
experience with statistics or programming.  

ponder uses [Spring MVC](LINK) as the web application framework, [Thrift](LINK)
for communication with the API syncing service, [d3](LINK) for visualizations,
[jQuery](LINK) and [bootstrap](LINK) for UI.  By far the largest challenge has
been working with third-party APIs, which have quite divergent opinions on how
to deal with time, data formatting, pagination, etc.

This project draws heavily on ethnographic research and visual/interaction
design from the team at [Intel Labs](LINK).  I've slowly come to accept that,
even in software engineering, many of the hardest problems are not
engineering problems - and so it is with this project.  Without the dedicated
work of [Dawn Nafus](LINK), [Pete Denman](LINK), [Lama Nachman](LINK), and
several others, this project would never have come to fruition.
