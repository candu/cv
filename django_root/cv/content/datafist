[datafist](LINK) is an in-browser toolkit for visually exploring your personal
data.   Similar to [Max/MSP](LINK) or [PureData](LINK), datafist offers a
[visual programming](LINK) interface built around a toolkit of
simple, composable operations.  As you play around with these operations, the
result is simultaneously visualized.  The goal was to create a simple open-source
tool that less technically-inclined self-trackers could use to get more out of
their personal data.

Everything is client-side HTML5 and JavaScript (including the favicon!).  There
is no backend; just clone the repo and go!  It can handle files of up to
~20-25K data points.  Visualizations are built on top of [d3](LINK), with
[mootools](LINK) as a generic JavaScript library for everything else.  It makes
use of HTML5 [drag-and-drop](LINK) and [File API](LINK).

You can see a screencast of it in action [here](LINK), or play around with a
live version [here](LINK).  It currently requires Google Chrome.
