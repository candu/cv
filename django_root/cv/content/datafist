[datafist](https://github.com/candu/datafist) is an *in-browser toolkit for visually exploring your personal
data.*   Similar to [Max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSA9fYLqDCU) or [PureData](http://puredata.info/), datafist offers a
[visual programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language) interface built around a toolkit of
simple, composable operations.  As you play around with these operations, the
result is simultaneously visualized.  The goal was to create a simple open-source
tool to help all self-trackers get more out of their personal data, regardless
of experience with programming or statistics.

Everything is *HTML5 and JavaScript* (including the [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme)!).  There
is no backend; just clone the repo and go!  It can handle files of up to
~20K data points quite easily.  Visualizations are built on top of [d3](http://d3js.org/), with
[mootools](http://mootools.net/) as the base JavaScript library.  It makes use of
HTML5 [drag-and-drop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop) and [FileReader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) APIs.

You can [watch a demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypitHPXKa8M), play around with a
[live version](http://datafist.savageevan.com/), or [read my blog post](http://blog.savageevan.com/blog/2012/12/21/datafist-exploration-and-analysis/) about datafist.
datafist currently requires Google Chrome.
