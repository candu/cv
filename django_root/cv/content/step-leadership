STEP educates the public about sustainable technologies by 
raising funds towards renewable energy projects on the University of Waterloo
campus.

I *organized on-campus talks by leading experts* in renewable energy and
sustainable design, *developed administration tools* for the STEP website,
and helped *promote STEP* at community events.
