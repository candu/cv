STEP educates the public about sustainable technologies by 
raising funds towards renewable energy projects on the University of Waterloo
campus. More information on their existing projects can be found
[here](http://www.step.uwaterloo.ca/projects.php).

I *organized on-campus talks by leading experts* in renewable energy and
sustainable design, *developed administration tools* for the
[STEP website](http://www.step.uwaterloo.ca/),
and helped *promote STEP* at community events.
