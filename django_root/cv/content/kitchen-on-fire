Through local culinary school [Kitchen on Fire](http://kitchenonfire.com/), I *help run cooking
classes for groups of 10-25 people.*  This includes preparing ingredients
and demonstration recipes, setting up stations, aiding students during
class, and cleaning up the kitchen afterwards.

As an exchange of services, it's not half-bad.  I get to meet interesting
people, eat tasty food, and refine my culinary knowledge at no personal
financial cost.  In exchange, Kitchen on Fire keeps its costs low, and is
able to devote more of its spare resources to nutritional outreach programs
for low-income families.
