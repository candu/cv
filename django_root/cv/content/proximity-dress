I worked with [Valkyrie Savage](https://www.facebook.com/valkyrie) to *design,
build, and program Arduino-based electronics* for her wedding dress.
Using two XBee modules, an Arduino Fio, and an Arduino Lilypad with XBee
breakout board, we *constructed a proximity sensor* based on RSSI pin
signal strength between the two modules. This sensor was used to illuminate
a series of LEDs on her dress, providing a visual indication of our
mutual proximity.
