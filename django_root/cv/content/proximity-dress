I worked with [Valkyrie Savage](https://www.facebook.com/valkyrie) to *design,
build, and program Arduino-based electronics* for her wedding dress.
Using two
[XBee modules](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8664),
an [Arduino Fio](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10116), and
an [Arduino Lilypad](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9266) with
the [XBee breakout board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8937),
we *constructed a proximity sensor* based on RSSI pin signal strength between
the two modules. This sensor was used to illuminate
a series of LEDs on her dress, providing a visual indication of our
mutual proximity.

The code for this project is available on
[Github](https://github.com/candu/proximity-dress).
