Outstanding students are invited to *provide paid tutoring services*
for freshman and sophomore Mathematics courses through the
[Mathematics Tutorial Centre](http://math.uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/mathematics-tutorial-centre).
I tutored *hundreds of students over four years* in Linear Algebra, Calculus,
and Combinatorics.
