My work with [Idée](http://ideeinc.com/) was diverse.
I developed a toolkit for evaluating high-dimensional Approximate
Nearest Neighbor algorithms. I then worked with a designer to build and release
[Idée Labs](http://labs.ideeinc.com/), a Pylons-based web application
featuring *visual search across millions of images*. I also collected feedback
on the PHP-based internal operator interface, implementing requested fixes
and improvements.

I *learned Python in a day*, then used it to build database migration scripts.
My next Python project after that used Amazon APIs to
*scrape millions of book covers*, allowing us to
*identify thousands of infringing uses* of client images in those covers.

For the last couple of weeks, I *researched methods for matching images against
user sketches*, implementing a prototype algorithm based on curve extraction 
and [Hausdorff distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance).
