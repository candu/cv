My first term at Idée marked the only time I've ever been able to walk to work. If you're familiar with Toronto, you'll know that the route [from Church and Gerrard to Queen and Sherbourne](http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=church+and+gerrard,+toronto&daddr=idee+inc,+toronto&hl=en&sll=43.656515,-79.37428&sspn=0.009113,0.01133&geocode=FVMymgIds8dE-yndC7_uSsvUiTE_LO-7bn8IkA%3BFZYcmgId7OhE-yEpUQX9E9cY8CmN2dpuN8vUiTGou-CB-n4Rdw&vpsrc=0&dirflg=w&mra=ltm&t=h&z=16) is interesting to say the least.

I'm betting the real estate for their office was bargain basement cheap. Good call for a starving startup.
