I wrote a raytracer with randomized supersampling, Phong lighting, and *support
for implicit surfaces*. For my final project, I *wrote a procedural content
generation engine* to render interactive natural landscapes with
fractal trees, *rocks based on [Catmull-Clark subdivision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catmull%E2%80%93Clark_subdivision_surface)*, and
multiple-frequency Perlin noise textures.
