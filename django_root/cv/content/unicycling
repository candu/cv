My current non-technical project is to *learn to unicycle*, which I'm doing
with the [Toronto Unicyclists](http://torontounicyclists.ca/).  It makes a great complement to the
sedentary, cerebral nature of my day job - nothing better than kinesthetic
skill development to unwind after a long day spent coding!

So far, I've been making decent progress; I can remain balanced during
regular riding, and have just started to get the hang of freemounting
(i.e. mounting the unicycle without using a wall or other static object to
keep balance.)
