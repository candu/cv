I presented at the [Meeting of the Minds 2013](http://cityminded.org/events/toronto) conference as part of a
workshop on [Chaos in Urbanism](http://cityminded.org/talk/chaos-urbanism-harnessing-uncertainty-successful-cities).  At its root, this workshop was a
study in contradictions: on the governance/policy level, how do you manage
chaos generated by accelerating change?

My talk was about the idea of *interactive governance*, a form of leadership
that places primary importance on near-immediate, continuous, and two-way
communication with external entities.  Digital natives take these qualities
for granted, yet the same qualities remain partially or totally absent from our interactions with
governments and other large, bureaucratic organizations.  There's a cultural
dissonance here, and it's not going away anytime soon.

In preparation for the workshop, I also contributed a [blog post](http://cityminded.org/the-proliferation-of-connected-mobile-technology-in-southeast-asia-8916) on
the global spread of technology and internet culture, drawing on examples from
my [travels in Southeast Asia](http://ramblelust.savageinter.net/).
