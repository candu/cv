I wrote a [series of blog posts](http://blog.savageevan.com/) discussing several of my self-tracking
experiments.  Most of these are accompanied by *code snippets and visualizations*
explaining my approaches to making sense of the underlying data, all of which
is [available on github](https://github.com/candu/quantified-savagery-files).  The blog itself is based off the excellent
[Octopress](http://octopress.org/) engine.

Visualizations for Quantified Savagery were built using [d3](http://d3js.org/), a
JavaScript library for building interactive DOM-based visualizations.  Most
of the standalone analysis scripting was done in Python, with little bits
of bash scripting sprinkled throughout.

I've since added a couple of posts to this blog, but most of my blogging
activity here was confined to the end of 2012.  It served me very well as
a soapbox for my thoughts on personal data, especially in the post-Facebook
time vacuum before I shifted my attention to more intensive engineering
projects.
