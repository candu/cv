Having completed our crazy bike trip,
[Valkyrie Savage](https://www.facebook.com/valkyrie) and I wanted a
further test of our athletic prowess. We *trained for six months* with
*three to six hours of running per week*. It paid off; we completed the
[Little Grand Canyon Marathon](http://mammothmarathons.org/little-grand-canyon-marathon/)
at *6000 feet elevation* in *just under six hours*.

[Here's proof](http://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=14626).
I took Valkyrie's last name after our marriage, so I'm listed under my
birth name of [Evan Stratford](http://cv.evanstratford.com).
