- Completed the Little Grand Canyon Marathon after six months of training
- Committed to 3-6 hours of training per week

Having completed our crazy bike trip, [Valkyrie Savage](https://www.facebook.com/valkyrie) and I wanted a further test of our athletic prowess. Watery beer aside, Utah has some fantastic scenery; we saw fossilized dinosaur footprints and millenia-old pictograms.
