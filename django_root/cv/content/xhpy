XHPy is a Python port of Facebook's [XHP](https://github.com/facebook/xhp). It
installs an [import hook](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302/) that
dynamically rewrites code as it is imported. The parser uses
[Pratt top-down operator precedence](http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html),
and is composed of a series of generators that stream the output of
[tokenize](http://docs.python.org/library/tokenize.html).

Development releases are available on [github](https://github.com/candu/xhpy);
see [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xhpy/0.8) for more stable versions.
