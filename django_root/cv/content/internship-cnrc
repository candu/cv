For this internship, I worked with CNRC's award-winning PORTAGE system for
statistical machine translation. I designed and built a module to
cluster similar phrases, then scaled it to handle the 2008 GALE
Chinese-English corpus with 40 million phrase pairs. I also implemented
Xu-Zens-Ney bilingual sentence segmentation, *reducing our Hidden Markov
Model training time by over 80%*.

The phrase clustering work resulted in co-authorship on the paper
*Phrase Clustering for Smoothing TM Probabilities*, which was accepted
at COLING 2010.
