For this internship, I worked with the award-winning
[PORTAGE](http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/W/W05/W05-0822.pdf) 
*statistical machine translation system*. I *designed and built a module to
cluster similar phrases*, then scaled it to handle corpora with tens of
millions of phrase pairs. I also implemented
[Xu-Zens-Ney bilingual sentence segmentation](http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/W/W06/W06-3111.pdf),
*reducing translation model training time by over 80%*.

The phrase clustering work resulted in co-authorship on the paper
[Phrase Clustering for Smoothing TM Probabilities](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~foster/papers/phrasecluster-coling10.pdf),
which was accepted at [COLING 2010](http://www.coling-2010.org/).
