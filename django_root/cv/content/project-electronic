- Learned the use of MIDI sequencing and multitrack compositional software, recording 12 tracks over my senior year of secondary school
- Led small software and recording workshops for younger students
- Designed insert and disc art for short-run CD production

This was my Graduation Project at the University of Toronto Schools. Although I can't claim it as a financial success, that wasn't the point; I was obsessed with recording technology, and I'm eternally grateful to [FAUJ](http://ca.ratemyteachers.com/john-fautley/99661-t) for enabling this obsession.
