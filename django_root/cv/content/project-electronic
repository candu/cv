For my Graduation Project at the [University of Toronto Schools](http://www.utschools.ca/), *I recorded
and produced a full-length CD* of original electronic music. While learning
to use MIDI sequencers and multitrack compositional software, I also
*led recording workshops* for younger students. Aside from the musical
composition, I *designed the insert and disc art* and *sourced short-run
production houses*.

I was obsessed with recording technology, and I'm eternally grateful to
[John Fautley](http://ca.ratemyteachers.com/john-fautley/99661-t) for enabling
this obsession. If I ever quit software to become a successful recording
artist, I'll have him to thank.
