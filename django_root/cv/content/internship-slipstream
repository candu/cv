I worked with several other co-op students to *double automation coverage of
manual testing procedures*. As part of this, I helped develop an *XPCOM
extension bridge* between Mozilla Firefox and [IBM Rational Robot](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/tester/robot/).

This XPCOM bridge was a gloriously terrible hack made necessary by the QA
team's insistence on using Rational Robot. I created a Javascript XPCOM component
for sending data to a DLL built by another member of the team, enabling us
to pass browser state to Rational Robot.
