I worked with Google's AdSense team, using Javascript
cross-domain communication techniques to implement client-side batching for
ad block requests. This was in the dark days before postMessage() [gained
reasonable adoption](http://caniuse.com/#feat=x-doc-messaging), so it
involved a good deal of hackery with javascript: URLs and 
dynamically-generated script tags.

I also wrote a Google Spreadsheets widget for generating heightmaps as part of
an internal Google Docs hackathon.

This was my first time down to the Bay Area, so I deliberately spent a week in
San Francisco before starting my internship. I met a variety of curious
characters in that week. The most curious was a blond-haired drunk who had
spent the last few months roving between music festivals. He pulled out a
newspaper, wrote "Everyone Lies" on it in thick gold marker, and offered me a
half-cupful of vodka. The second most curious was a spindly hacker type who
spent his evenings blasting original [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/)
compositions in the hostel common room.

I knew I'd come to the right place.
