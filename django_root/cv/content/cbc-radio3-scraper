CBC Radio 3 runs [New Music Canada](http://radio3.cbc.ca/), a database for
Canadian artists. Music uploaded there is freely available, and can be listened
to through the player on that site.

Using Firebug and Wireshark, I *reverse-engineered* this player to get at the
underlying audio file URLs. I then built a
[Python-based scraper](http://code.google.com/p/evan-stratford-public/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Futils%2Fcbc3)
for retrieving those URLs and populating metadata. With this scraper,
I downloaded their entire selection of Funk and Electro. Finally, I loaded
this collection into [Quod Libet](http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/), using
its automatic rating and rating-weighted shuffle plugins to discover my
favorite content.
