[expedition!](LINK) is a *quest-based learning game*, where the quests are
knowledge-gathering tasks at specific locations.  [Valkyrie Savage] and I built
a [functioning alpha-stage prototype](LINK) (TODO: bring this back up).
Some examples of quests from our early players:

(TODO: list of quests)

The game is built using [node.js](LINK), [PostgreSQL](LINK) with
[PostGIS](LINK), [redis](LINK), [OpenStreetMap](LINK), [bootstrap](LINK),
and [jQuery](LINK).  Our node.js stack uses [fibrous](LINK) to manage
callbacks, offering a coroutine-based style of control flow that will be
familiar to anyone who has used [Python generators](LINK).

In the process, I also built [node-int64-native](LINK), a *native extension
to node.js* that offers an idiomatic JavaScript wrapper around `uint64_t`
values.  This is primarily useful when dealing with 64-bit IDs in databases.
