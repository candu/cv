[expedition!](https://expedition.savageinter.net/) is a *quest-based learning game*, where the quests are
knowledge-gathering tasks at specific locations.  [Valkyrie Savage](http://valkyriesavage.com/) and I built
a [functioning prototype](https://expedition.savageinter.net/), which is currently in invite-only mode.
Some examples of quests from our early players:

- [Visit the bat pagoda in Soc Trang province, Vietnam](https://expedition.savageinter.net/quests/19)
- [find the origin of the name Ypsilanti](https://expedition.savageinter.net/quests/13)
- [Join E Clampus Vitus](https://expedition.savageinter.net/quests/9)
- [Check out the Fishing Pier at Berkeley Marina](https://expedition.savageinter.net/quests/7)

expedition! uses [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) with
[PostGIS](http://postgis.net/), [redis](http://redis.io/), [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),
and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).  We sidestep [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/) by using [fibrous](https://github.com/goodeggs/fibrous)
which offers a `yield` syntax similar to [Python generators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators).

In the process, I also built `int64-native`, a *native extension
to node.js* that offers an idiomatic JavaScript wrapper around `uint64_t`
values.  `int64-native` is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/int64-native) and
[github](https://github.com/candu/node-int64-native)
