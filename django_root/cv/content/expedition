[expedition!](https://expedition.savageinter.net/) is a *quest-based learning game*, where the quests are
knowledge-gathering tasks at specific locations.  [Valkyrie Savage](http://valkyriesavage.com/) and I built
a [functioning alpha-stage prototype](https://expedition.savageinter.net/) (TODO: bring this back up).
Some examples of quests from our early players:

(TODO: list of quests)

The game is built using [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) with
[PostGIS](http://postgis.net/), [redis](http://redis.io/), [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),
and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).  Our node.js stack uses [fibrous](https://github.com/goodeggs/fibrous) to manage
callbacks, offering a coroutine-based style of control flow that will be
familiar to anyone who has used [Python generators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators).

In the process, I also built `int64-native`, a *native extension
to node.js* that offers an idiomatic JavaScript wrapper around `uint64_t`
values.  This is primarily useful when dealing with 64-bit IDs in databases.
`int64-native` is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/int64-native) and [github](https://github.com/candu/node-int64-native)
