I worked with
[Ondrej Ruttkay](http://cz.linkedin.com/pub/ondrej-ruttkay/8/5aa/608)
to design and build an embedded microkernel based on
[Send-Receive-Reply message-passing](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SendReceiveReply)
for the ARM-based [Cirrus EP9302](http://www.cirrus.com/en/products/ep9302.html).
We then built an application for this microkernel to control
[MÃ¤rklin model trains](http://www.marklin.com/).
